AI-Based Climate Risk Assessment for Agriculture
This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline built using Langflow, IBM watsonx.ai, and DataStax Astra DB. It allows users to upload agricultural policy documents or climate guidelines and interact with specialized AI agents to assess climate risks and receive advisory planning.

🚀 Features
Document Ingestion: Automatically parses and chunks PDF documents for efficient information retrieval.

Vector Search: Uses semantic search via Astra DB to find relevant context instead of simple keyword matching.

Multi-Agent Intelligence: Features specialized agents for Climate Risk, Advisory, and Planning to provide expert-level insights.

Powered by IBM watsonx: Utilizes slate-125m for high-quality embeddings and llama-3-70b for sophisticated reasoning.

🛠️ Langflow Components Used
1) Chat Input
The entry point for the retrieval flow. It captures user queries and initiates the search and generation process.

2) IBM watsonx AI Agents
A suite of specialized agent components including Climate Risk, Advisory, and Planning. These agents use specific "System Messages" to act as domain experts when processing retrieved data.

3) File Component (Read File)
Used in the ingestion phase to load source documents (e.g., booklet-final-web.pdf) and extract raw text for processing.

4) Chat Output
The final stage of the pipeline that displays the AI-generated expert response back to the user.

5) Core Infrastructure Components
Split Text: Breaks documents into 1000-character chunks with a 200-character overlap to preserve context.

Embedding Model (IBM watsonx.ai): Translates text into numerical vectors representing semantic meaning.

Astra DB: A vector database used to Ingest Data (storage) and perform Search Queries (retrieval).

Parser: Formats retrieved data objects into clean strings for the AI to read.

Prompt: A template that merges user questions with retrieved context to guide the AI's response.

📖 How to Use
Ingestion: Upload your PDF through the Read File component and run the flow to populate your Astra DB collection.

Query: Type your question into the Chat Input.

Result: Review the expert assessment generated by the AI Agents in the Chat Output.
